**Angular application with following views -**

**1) View 1 -**

- A view to list all books, characters and houses in same repeater (ngFor). The view should use bootstrap cards to display the information. One type of card (for example a card displaying a book) should look different from another type of card(for example a card displaying a house). The view difference can be as simple as change of border color according to the category(red for books, blue for characters and green for houses). The data should be sorted in alphabetical order.

**2) View 2 -**

- On clicking the card, a view containing the detail of that book/character/house should open containing all the information about it in details.
